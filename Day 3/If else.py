# Condition Check
# Learn to use conditionals in python to check a conditions and tell the computer  what to do in each case. e.g
# if <this condition is true>:

#     <then execute this line of code>
# What if the condition is false?
# The else keyword is used to define a block of code that will execute if the condition checked in the if statement is False
# if pigs can fly:

#     <Some code that will never execute>

# else:

#     print("This is real life")
print("Welcome to the rollercoaster!")
height = int(input("What's your height in cm?"))

if height >= 120:
    print("you can ride the rollercoaster")
else:
    print("sorry you have to grow taller before you can ride.")

# python Indentation
# Understand the importance of indentation in python as a way to make certain lines of code subsidaries of other lines of code.
# e.g.

# if 5 > 2: #This is a parent line of code

#     print("yes") #this is a child line of code
# Comparator Operators
# > Greater than
# < Less than
# >= Greater than or equal to
# <= Less than or equal to
# == Equal to
# != Not equal to
